            <p>You´re seeing this offline page, because we´ve decided to make Dergun Town only accesable at
                certain
                times of
                day.
                Please don´t worry, this isn´t a problem with your computer, browser, or connection to the

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions: </h2>
        <p><b>Why are you doing this?</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>We´ve been in discussion with the Pony Town development team since we first opened Dergun Town. Q and I did
            not
            anticipate that we would attract such a large player base so quickly.
            As much as it´s been great to see you all come on and enjoy Dergun Town, there are some underlying issues
            that
            we need to address in terms of moderation, hosting costs and more.
            Both we and the Pony Town team have agreed that it is best to try and solve these problems while the server
            is
            still relatively small, with a more maintainable player base.
            The site being offline at certain times of day is our solution to limiting the expansion of players while we
            work in improving the game and becoming more independent from the official Pony Town game in terms of art
            style
            and mechanics. This measure will also help to reduce server costs.</p>

        <p><b>How long will this go on for?</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>I don´t know exactly, it will not be permanent though.</p>

        <p><b>When will the site be up and when will it be down? Is there a timetable?</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>At the moment, we´re starting with a broad time frame where the server will be up, rather than a sudden
            change. There will be server wide announcements letting players know when the server will be switched off.
            This time is designed for you to save your character / house so that you don´t lose any progress. Times that
            the server will go offline are controlled manually by me, and as we´re experimenting with this idea, there
            is no timetable / schedule yet.</p>

    <br> <br>
    <div id="container">

        <p><b>The server is off right when I want to play! Can you switch it back on?</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>No, if this process is going to work, I can´t turn the server back on at people’s requests.
            If enough people come to me complaining about this, then we will look at changing the times that we
            shutdown.
            We will setup a poll inside our Discord server, (https://discord.derguns.town) where we will poll the
            community about better times.</p>
